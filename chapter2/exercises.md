1. The second Split is more orthogonal. It could take in a line from anywhere rather than the first one which needs an InputStreamReader to accept input.

2. Modeless because if a system has to stop before it can perform something, it doesn't seem the most decoupled... If that makes sense xD

3. Definitely object technology. The features that make it powerful: encapsulation, inheritance, etc all scream orthogonal.
