By the same token, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinely beautiful -- cleanly written, well designed, and elegant--you will likely take extra special care  not to mess it up, just like the firefighters.

We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose (what Yourdon and Constantine call *cohesion*). When components are isolated from one another, you know that you can change one without having to worry about the rest. As long as you don't change that component's external interfaces, you can be comfortable that you won't cause problems that ripple through the entire system.

Get into the habit of being constantly critical of your code. Look for any opportunities to reorganize it to improve its structure and orthogonality. This process is called *refactoring*, and it's so important that we've dedicated a section to it.
