# Some Useful Highlights

You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass of a project. If you continue to think like that, then you'd better plan on getting a dumpster, or moving to another neighborhood. **Don't let entropy win**

By the same token, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinely beautiful -- cleanly written, well designed, and elegant--you will likely take extra special care  not to mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there's a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.) *you* don't want to be the first one to make a mess.

##### page 35:
We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose (what Yourdon and Constantine call *cohesion*). When components are isolated from one another, you know that you can change one without having to worry about the rest. As long as you don't change that component's external interfaces, you can be comfortable that you won't cause problems that ripple through the entire system.

Get into the habit of being constantly critical of your code. Look for any opportunities to reorganize it to improve its structure and orthogonality. This process is called *refactoring*, and it's so important that we've dedicated a section to it.

Remember, if you see hoof prints, think horses -- not zebras. The OS is probably not broken. And the database is probably just fine.

Suppose Fred is given a programming assignment. Fred types in some code, tries it, and it seems to work. Fred types in some more code, tries it, and it still seems to work. After several weeks of coding this way, the program suddenly stops working, and after hours of trying to fix it, he still doesn't know why. Fred may well spend a significant amount of time chasing this piece of code around without ever being able to fix it. No matter what he does, it just doesn't ever seem to work right.

Fred doesn't know why the code is failing because *he didn't know why it worked in the first place.* It seemed to work, given the limited "testing" that Fred did, but that was just a coincidence. Buoyed by false confidence, Fred charged ahead into oblivion. Now, most intelligent people may know someone like Fred, but we know better. We don't rely on coincidences--do we?

Sometimes we might. Sometimes it can be pretty easy to confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.
