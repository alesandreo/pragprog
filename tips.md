# Tips

## 1. Care About Your Craft
There is no point in developing software unless one cares about doing it well.

## 2. Think! About Your Work
Don't just do. Stop and think about what you are doing. Critique and appraise your work as you go.

## 3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
Never say that something can't be done. Instead, come up with options of how it *can* be done.

## 4. Don't Live with Broken Windows
Don't let broken windows exist in code (bad design, poor code, etc). Either fix the window or board it up until it can be fixed.

## 5. Be a Catalyst for Change
Change cannot be forced upon other people, but it can be shown. Try and let other people see how change can be accomplished and let others follow suit.

## 6. Remember the Big Picture
Try to keep an eye on the big picture. Always check what is going on around you.

## 7. Make Quality a Requirements Issue
Invovle your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.

## 8. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
As programmers, our knowledge is our biggest asset. It should be improved upon *every* day that we exist. Make learning a daily habit.

## 9. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
Everything that enters your head should be filtered and compared to what you already know. Don't just take things *as is*, make sure it's right.

## 10. It's Both What You Say and How You Say It
Content is only half of it. Having an idea and communicating it effectively is just as important.

## 11. DRY -- Don't Repeat Yourself
...

## 12. Make It Easy to Reuse
To keep up with the DRY principle, make things with others in mind.

## 13. Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things
When designing things, keep them independent which will make them easier to use.

## 14. There Are No Final Decisions
Nothing should be set in stone.

## 15. Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
Use tracer bullets in code to hone in on your target. Being close gives more advantages than not knowing where your target is.

## 16. Prototype to Learn
The code doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that you learn how something works.

## 17. Program Close to the Problem Domain
Coding at a higher level of abstraction leaves you able to concentrate on solving domain problems.

## 18. Estimate to Avoid Surprises
Making a thorough and accurate estimate on a project can help spot problems up front.

## 19. Iterate the Schedule with the Code
Make adjustments as you go to keep the schedule as accurate as possible.

## 20. Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
Simpler is always better.

## 21. Use the Power of Command Shells
Utilize the tools you have to do you best work.

## 22. Use a Single Editor Well
In other words, learn VIM really well ;)

## 23. Always Use Source Code Control
This is a must for any serious developer.

## 24. Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
Blaming someone for a bug is pointless, rather than doing that, just fix it.

## 25. Don't Panic
In the spirit of Douglas Adams, this belongs on any list ;)

## 26. "select" Isn't Broken
Basically the bug most likely resides in your code, not the OS, compiler, or third party libraries.

## 27. Don't Assume It--Prove It
Prove your assumptions in the actual environment--with real data and boundary conditions.

## 28. Learn a Text Manipulation Language
You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?

## 29. Write Code That Writes Code
Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.

## 30. You Can't Write Perfect Software
Software can't be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.

## 31. Design with Contracts
Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less that it claims to do.

## 32. Crash Early
A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.
