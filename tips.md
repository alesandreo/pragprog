# Tips

## 1. Care About Your Craft
There is no point in developing software unless one cares about doing it well.

## 2. Think! About Your Work
Don't just do. Stop and think about what you are doing. Critique and appraise your work as you go.

## 3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
Never say that something can't be done. Instead, come up with options of how it *can* be done.
