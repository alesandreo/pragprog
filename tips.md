# Tips

Don't just do. Stop and think about what you are doing. Critique and appraise your work as you go.

## 3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
Never say that something can't be done. Instead, come up with options of how it *can* be done.

## 4. Don't Live with Broken Windows
Don't let broken windows exist in code (bad design, poor code, etc). Either fix the window or board it up until it can be fixed.

## 5. Be a Catalyst for Change
Change cannot be forced upon other people, but it can be shown. Try and let other people see how change can be accomplished and let others follow suit.
